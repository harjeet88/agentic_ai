It supports complex decision-making processes with features like branching, looping, and asynchronous task execution, making it suitable for applications such as loan processing and workflow automation. ([phyniks.com](https://phyniks.com/blog/top-7-agentic-ai-frameworks-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen focuses on multi-agent systems and code automation. It enables agents to communicate in natural language, facilitating tasks like planning, development, and review. AutoGen includes built-in agents and a graphical interface for prototyping, aiming to simplify the creation of collaborative AI agents. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **CrewAI**: CrewAI emphasizes role-based task execution, assigning specific roles to agents to complete complex workflows. This approach mimics real-world team dynamics, enhancing specialization and task division, and is particularly effective in data science and content creation projects. ([odsc.medium.com](https://odsc.medium.com/top-10-open-source-ai-agent-frameworks-to-know-in-2025-c739854ec859?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Eliza**: Eliza is an open-source, Web3-friendly AI agent operating system that integrates seamlessly with blockchain applications. It allows for the deployment of AI agents capable of interacting with smart contracts and blockchain data, expanding the scope of AI agents into decentralized environments. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **AutoAgent**: AutoAgent is a fully automated, zero-code framework for LLM agents, enabling users to create and deploy AI agents through natural language instructions. It comprises components like an actionable engine and a self-managing file system, facilitating efficient agent development without coding requirements. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese frameworks reflect the rapid advancements in AI agent development, offering diverse tools for building intelligent, autonomous systems across various applications.
